# AI AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING WEB3 CRYPTOCURRENCY APP
 A decentralized AI model training platform leverages blockchain and distributed computing to create a peer-to-peer network where participants can contribute their GPU resources to train AI models. This system operates all by:

1. Model Selection: Users choose from available open-source AI models (like GPT variants or BERT) as their base architecture.

2. Resource Pooling: GPU owners stake their computing resources on the network, earning tokens for their contributions.

3. Smart Contract Management: Training tasks are distributed via smart contracts, ensuring fair resource allocation and compensation.

4. Distributed Training: The selected model is trained across multiple nodes using federated learning principles, maintaining data privacy while leveraging collective computing power.

5. Validation & Consensus: Network participants validate training results through consensus mechanisms, ensuring quality and preventing malicious behavior.

6. Token Economics: Contributors earn rewards based on computing power provided and training quality, creating a sustainable ecosystem.

The platform democratizes AI development while ensuring transparency and reducing dependency on centralized cloud providers.
Now we will see the prototype. The App is built using React, Tailwind CSS and Blockchain.
